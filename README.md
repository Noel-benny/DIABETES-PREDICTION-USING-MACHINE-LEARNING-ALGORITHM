DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM

ABSTRACT:
Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose levels in the human body.Diabetes can
be controlled if it is predicted earlier. To achieve this goal in this project work we will do
early prediction of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for a higher accuracy by applying
Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning techniques Provide better results for
prediction by constructing models from data sets collected from patients. In this work we will
use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes
which are high in their accuracy score which tells how accurate and efficient the prediction is.

INTRODUCTION:
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too
high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin,
a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for
energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough or any insulin or doesn’t use insulin well.
Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Over time, having too much
glucose in your blood can cause health problems.
According to the International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with
diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million.early
prediction of diabetes is quite challenging task for medical practitioners due to complex
interdependence on various factors as diabetes affects human organs such as kidney, eye,
heart, nerves, foot etc.the ascent of machine learning, AI, and neural systems, and their
application in various domains we have the option to find an answer for this issue.ML
strategies and neural systems help scientists to find new realities from existing well being
related informational indexes, which may help in ailment supervision and detection.
Types of diabetes
There are three main types of diabetes – type 1, type 2 and gestational.
● Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but occurs most frequently in children and
adolescents. When you have type 1 diabetes, your body produces very little or no
insulin, which means that you need daily insulin injections to maintain blood glucose
levels under control. Learn more.
● Type 2 diabetes is more common in adults and accounts for around 90% of all
diabetes cases. When you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make good use of
the insulin that it produces. The cornerstone of type 2 diabetes treatment is a healthy
lifestyle, including increased physical activity and a healthy diet. However, over time
most people with type 2 diabetes will require oral drugs and/or insulin to keep their
blood glucose levels under control.
● Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that consists of high blood glucose
during pregnancy and is associated with complications to both mother and child.
GDM usually disappears after pregnancy but women affected and their children are at
increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
The basic exploratory analysis is used to pre-process and select the relevant features from the
diabetes data, and the machine learning method helps automate diabetes prediction . Data
mining and machine learning algorithms can help identify the hidden pattern of data using the
methods hence, a reliable accuracy decision is possible.
